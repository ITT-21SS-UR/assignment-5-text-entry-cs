In this paper the authors developed a novel hands-free text entry by combining
eye-tracking and humming.
For this they implemented and evaluated two design choices: "HumHum" and
"Hummer" which were also validated by comparing them with the sophisticated
baseline for handsfree text entry, "EyeSwipe" (a gaze-based hands-free method).
With "HumHum" the beginning and the end of a word is hummed briefly.
In the other choice one continuous humming counts as the start and end of a word.
Their conducted experiment with 12 participants showed that "Hummer"
(20.45 words per minute) outperformed "HumHum" and "EyeSwipe" in quantitative
and qualitative measures.

The authors implemented "PhraseFlow" a phrase-level input keyboard that is able
to correct preceding text based on the subsequently input sequences.
"PhraseFlow" was optimized through an iterative design-implement-research
process in which they created visual feedback effects and interaction methods
that reduced the cognitive load of phrase level input.
They found out that phrase-level decoding had a higher accuracy on correction
tasks than word-level decoding including space-related errors.
In their in-lab experiment they demonstrated that users could adapt to
"PhraseFlow" quickly which resulted in 19% lesser error without losing speed.
From their real life study which lasted for six days, 78,6 % out of 42
participants would like to have phrase-level input in future keyboards.

Mediating Intimacy with DearBoard: a Co-Customizable Keyboard for Everyday
Messaging. In Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in
Computing Systems (CHI '21). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY,
USA, Article 342, 1–16. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445757

The authors investigated collaborative customizations (co-customizations) in
everyday messaging and how people in close relationsships use co-customizations
in their  established communication app ecosystems.
For that they created "DearBoard" an Android keyboard where users can
co-customize the color theme and toolbar of expressions shortcuts (emojis and
GIFs).
When their coressponding partner changes their keyboard style the changes can be
seen by the other person.
To understand what role co-customizations may play in online relationsship
maintenance, they conducted a 5-week field study with 18 pairs of couples, close
friends and relatives where participants communicated with their partner and
shared the "DearBoard".
They found out that participants expressed their intimacy with co-customizations
by e.g. changing the color theme to a color that describes their shared identity.
