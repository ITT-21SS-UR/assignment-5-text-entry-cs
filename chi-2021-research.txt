In this paper the authors developed a novel hands-free text entry by combining
eye-tracking and humming.
For this they implemented and evaluated two design choices: "HumHum" and
"Hummer". These were validated by comparing them to the mature baseline for
hands-free text input, "EyeSwipe" (a gaze-based hands-free method).
In "HumHum", the beginning and end of a word is briefly buzzed, whereas in
another variant, a continuous buzz marks the beginning and end of a word.
Their conducted experiment with 12 participants showed that "Hummer"
(with an average of 20.45 words per minute) outperformed "HumHum" and
"EyeSwipe" in quantitative and qualitative measures.

Studies of Phrase-Level Input. In Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on

The authors implemented "PhraseFlow" a phrase-level input keyboard capable
of correcting preceding text based on subsequent input sequences.
"PhraseFlow" was optimized through an iterative design-implement-research
process in which they created visual feedback effects and interaction methods
that reduced the cognitive load of phrase level input.
They discovered that phrase-level decoding had a higher accuracy on correction
tasks than word-level decoding (including space-related errors).
In their in-lab experiment they demonstrated that users could quickly adapt to
"PhraseFlow", leading to a 19% lower error rate with no decrease in speed.
From their six-day hands-on study, 78.6% of the 42 participants would like to 
have phrase-level input in upcoming keyboards.

Mediating Intimacy with DearBoard: a Co-Customizable Keyboard for Everyday
Messaging. In Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in
Computing Systems (CHI '21). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY,
USA, Article 342, 1–16. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445757

The authors investigated collaborative customizations (co-customizations) in
everyday messaging and how people in close relationsships use co-customizations
in their  established communication app ecosystems.
For this purpose, they created "DearBoard" an Android keyboard that allows 
users to co-customize the color theme and toolbar of expressions shortcuts 
(emojis and GIFs).
When the coressponding partner changes his or her keyboard style the changes can 
be seen by the other person.
To understand what role co-customizations can play in online relationsship
maintenance, they conducted a 5-week field study with 18 pairs of couples, close
friends and relatives where participants communicated with their partner and
shared the "DearBoard".
They found out that participants expressed their intimacy with co-customizations,
such as changing the color theme to a color that described their shared identity.
